# NavaideIOS
This project is a laboratory for learning how to use Environment objects, swiftUI beyond simple lists etc. 

The finished content of this app is a tool pilots can use to learn density altitude, optimum runways at airports. Airports can be searched by FAA code or by geographic location. It can also give basic flight information like: speed over the ground, heading, altitude, wind drift, and vertical velocity. I may add more as I go along, but this is a start.

# Architecture
The app will be tab bar based navigation.

One tab will be the tool to show airports and the airport centric data

One tab will present the flight data

One tab will be utilities

Other tabs will be added as needed.
